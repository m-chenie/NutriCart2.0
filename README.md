In the busy modern lives of young adults, it is not always easy or convenient to maintain a healthy and nutritious diet.


However, it is tedious and repetitive to calculate the macronutrient intake for different needs per person every meal. With the rise of online grocery shopping, we wanted to create a tool that empowers users to make informed nutritional choices effortlessly.

We introduce **NutriCart** -  your online grocery companion. Helping you balance health and convenience in every click, by seamlessly tracking calories, protein, fibre and more!
